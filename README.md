This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app

```

## Link

It allows us to navigate to different pages.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

const page = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1 className="text-8xl">Home page</h1>
			<Link href="/about" className="m-8 text-red-900 inline-block text-xl">
				about page
			</Link>
		</div>
	);
};
export default page;
```

## Nested routes

To have a different nested routes, we have to create nested folders and inside each folder, we should have a `page.tsx`.

## Layout

It is a component that we place the part of the page that is shared across the pages.
when creating layout, it should be name `layout.tsx`.
We wrap the other part of the pages which are having the same layout into layout component.
`template`: one of the difference between layout and template is as navigate through different pages, we are not re-rendering the layout.

## Network Boundary

In web development, the Network Boundary is a conceptual line that separates the different environments. For example, the client and the server, or the server and the data store.

## Server Component

React Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server

- Static Rendering
- Dynamic Rendering
- Streaming

#### How are Server Components rendered?

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual route segments and Suspense Boundaries.

Each chunk is rendered in two steps:

React renders Server Components into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render HTML on the server.
Then, on the client:

The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route - this is for the initial page load only.
The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.
The JavaScript instructions are used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

[Server-Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)

## Client Component

Client Components allow you to write interactive UI that is prerendered on the server and can use client JavaScript to run in the browser.
Basically the client component is the part of the code that require some kind of activity from the server, for instance clicking a button, selecting a data on a calender.

#### Benefits of Client Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:

`Interactivity`: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
`Browser APIs`: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like geolocation or localStorage.

To use Client Components, you can add the React `use client` directive at the top of a file, above your imports.

[Client-Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)

## Nested Client component inside server component

There are more benefits in server components, but do we have to have a separate page for each client component at the cost of loosing server component's benefits? No
We can nest client component inside a server component, how?
Create a component, add all the client code in that file and import it into the relative page and use it there.

## Fetch

```ts
const url = "https://www.course-api.com/react-tours-project";

type Tour = {
	id: string;
	image: string;
	name: string;
	info: string;
};
const tours = async () => {
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const data: Tour[] = await response.json();
	console.log(data);
	return (
		<div>
			<h1 className="text-8xl">TOURS page</h1>
		</div>
	);
};
export default tours;
```

We cannot use `async` with client components.

Next.js is just awesome with caching, a giant caching machine.

## Error and loading

If there is an error or time consuming operation, we can use `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` to handle these cases.
the namings should exactly match.

if we place them in app directory, it will be applied to all pages and if we place them in specific directories, then they will applied to those pages only.

## Nested Layouts

We can place layouts inside each directory as well.

```tsx
import React from "react";

function layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<div>
			<header className="py-2 w-1/2 bg-slate-500 rounded">
				<h1 className="text-4xl text-white text-center">Nested layout</h1>
			</header>
			{children}
		</div>
	);
}
export default layout;
```

Here, `children` represents what ever files we have inside the directory that `layout.tsx` is located.

If we are having a dynamic route and based on that some params, we want to navigate to different routes, we need to create a folder with the param we want to access `[id]` and inside that folder set a page.

To navigate to that dynamic route, we can use `Link` component.

## <Image>

[Image-component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image)

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Page() {
	return (
		<Image
			src="/profile.png"
			width={500}
			height={500}
			alt="Picture of the author"
		/>
	);
}
```

```tsx
<div className="relative h-56 mb-4">
	<Image
		src={tour.image}
		alt={tour.name}
		fill
		priority
		sizes="100vws"
		className="object-cover rounded"></Image>
</div>
```

It is crucial to put the image inside a div and set the following classes `relative h-56`

#### Some key properties

### fill

This is a property used in Next.js's <Image> component that allows the image to automatically fill the parent container, making the image responsive. It stretches the image to cover the width and height of the container, maintaining its aspect ratio. When you use fill, the parent element must have a set position and dimensions (e.g., relative with defined width and height).

### priority

This flag indicates that the image should be prioritized for loading. Itâ€™s particularly useful for critical images, such as hero banners or above-the-fold content, where loading speed is essential for a good user experience.

### sizes="100vws"

The sizes attribute tells the browser how large the image will be on different screen sizes. The value 100vws means the image should take up 100% of the viewport's width (essentially full width). This helps optimize the image loading process by allowing the browser to load the correct image size based on the available space.

The fill property makes the image responsive to its parent container, and priority loads it faster.

## Complex routing

whatever folder we put in app directory, that will become part of url.

What if we don't want some folder to be part of our url segment? Add it to private folder? place \_ in front of the folder.

- Private Folder
  \_folder

Lets say we want to place our contents folder, go to app and create a folder `_contents`.

#### Grouping the routes

What if we want to group all the routes, for instance if we have a dashboard and in it we have profile, info, about. It would be tedious to have `dashboard/profile`, `dashboard/about` and so on.

using next, set the folder name with `()`.

(dashboard)

- auth
- profile

When we navigate, we don't navigate `dashboard/profile`, just `/profile` or `/auth`.

## Form Data

```ts
"use server";

export const createUser = async (formData: FormData) => {
	"user server";
	const firstName = formData.get("firstName") as string;
	const lastName = formData.get("lastName") as string;
	console.log({ firstName, lastName });
};
```

`use server`:This tells the framework (e.g., Next.js) that the function should run on the server side.

`async (formData: FormData)`: The function accepts a FormData object, which contains form data submitted from a client.

`formData`: This is a variable or parameter name that refers to the instance of FormData in the function.

`FormData`: This is a browser-provided class that represents form data and provides methods to work with it.

The function expects formData to be passed as an argument, containing the form data that you want to process. If you want to create formData from a form element, you would do that in the client-side code.

`const rawData = Object.fromEntries(formData)`, if there are multiple inputs, all the data can be retrieved using above snippet.

```ts
"use client";
import { createUser } from "../utils/actions";
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useFormState, useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

function SubmitBtn() {
	const { pending } = useFormStatus();
	return (
		<button type="submit" className={buttonStyle} disabled={pending}>
			{pending ? "submitting..." : "submit"}
		</button>
	);
}

function Form() {
	// Create a ref for the form element
	const formRef = useRef<HTMLFormElement>(null);

	return (
		<div className="grid justify-center items-center">
			<form
				ref={formRef}
				action={async (formData) => {
					// Call server-side action to create the user
					await createUser(formData);

					// Optional: Reset form fields after submission
					if (formRef.current) {
						formRef.current.reset();
					}
				}}
				className={formStyle}>
				<h1 className="text-4xl">Create a user</h1>
				<input
					type="text"
					name="firstName"
					placeholder="name"
					className={inputStyle}
					required
				/>
				<input
					type="text"
					name="lastName"
					placeholder="last name"
					className={inputStyle}
					required
				/>
				<SubmitBtn></SubmitBtn>
			</form>
		</div>
	);
}

const formStyle = `w-full max-w-96 flex flex-col gap-y-8 shadow-lg rounded p-8`;
const inputStyle = `border shadow rounded py-4 px-2 text-grey-7000`;
const buttonStyle = `bg-red-700 hover:bg-red-900 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded capitalize`;

export default Form;
```

## Backend development

```tsx
const saveUser = async (user: User) => {
	const users = await fetchUsers();
	users.push(user);
	await writeFile("users.json", JSON.stringify(users));
};
```

```ts
"use server";
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

type User = {
	id: string;
	firstName: string;
	lastName: string;
};

export const createUser = async (formData: FormData) => {
	"use server";
	await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
	const firstName = formData.get("firstName") as string;
	const lastName = formData.get("lastName") as string;
	const newUser: User = { firstName, lastName, id: Date.now().toString() };

	try {
		await saveUser(newUser);
		revalidatePath("/actions");
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error);
	}

	// redirect("/");
};

export const fetchUsers = async (): Promise<User[]> => {
	const result = await readFile("users.json", { encoding: "utf8" });
	const users = result ? JSON.parse(result) : [];
	return users;
};

const saveUser = async (user: User) => {
	const users = await fetchUsers(); // 'users' is a local variable
	users.push(user); // modifying the local 'users' array
	await writeFile("users.json", JSON.stringify(users)); // writing the updated 'users' array to a file
};
```

Why `await writeFile("users.json", JSON.stringify(users))`?

When you modify in-memory data (like pushing a new user to the users array), that change does not automatically update the underlying file or database where the original data came from. To make sure your changes are saved permanently, you must explicitly write the updated data back to the file.

### Issue

```tsx
import { fetchUsers } from "../utils/actions";

async function UserList() {
	const users = await fetchUsers();

	return (
		<div className="grid justify-center items-center mt-8">
			{users.length ? (
				<div>
					{users.map((user) => {
						return (
							<h4 key={user.id} className="text-4xl capitalize">
								{user.firstName} {user.lastName}
							</h4>
						);
					})}
				</div>
			) : (
				<div>
					<p>Users list is empty</p>
				</div>
			)}
		</div>
	);
}
export default UserList;
```

Every time the users submits the form, it is not going to reflect immediately, because next.js caches all the action files aggressively.

Two Solutions:

### revalidatePath

When a page is statically generated or cached (to improve performance), it doesn't automatically update when data changes.
revalidatePath("/actions") tells the system to revalidate or refresh the cached version of the page at the path "/actions".
We revalidate the cache file in the directory we are in.

```tsx
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";

export const createUser = async (formData: FormData) => {
	// rest of the code
	revalidatePath("/actions");
};
```

## useFormStatus

It gives information about status of our action, one of htem

useFormState and useFormStatus are hooks from the react-dom library. These hooks provide useful information about the current state of a form (e.g., whether it's pending submission or already submitted).

useFormStatus can only be used inside a component.

```ts
interface FormStatusNotPending {
	pending: false;
	data: null;
	method: null;
	action: null;
}
```

## useFormState:

#### Arguments

It takes two arguments, `useFormState(fn, init)`,
`fn`: is a function to be called when the form is submitted or the button is pressed.

`init` is the initial state of our form we want to be.

#### Returns

message: A state variable that holds any messages related to the form submission, such as success or error messages.
formAction: A function to handle form submission. This function is typically used as the action handler for the form.

### Form Submission:

When the form is submitted, the action function is called. This function uses formAction to handle the actual submission of the form data (via createUser).
After calling formAction, the form is reset using formRef.current.reset().
